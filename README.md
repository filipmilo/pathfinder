# European Cities Tour Planner

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The student is tasked with developing a program that plans a tour through a group of European cities, taking into account the total travel distance. The tourâ€”produced by the algorithmâ€”must include **all cities from a given list**, visiting **each city exactly once**, and **ending back at the starting city**.

The goal of the algorithm is to determine the **shortest possible tour**.

- **Sequential** â€“ Single-threaded version.
- **Parallel** â€“ Multi-threaded version, potentially accelerated using concurrency.
